# Ren'Py Minigames 101: A Udemy Course

This is the course material for my Udemy course, **[Ren'Py Minigames 101](https://www.udemy.com/course/renpy-minigames/?referralCode=46F88E557D14A0FDD973)**. Even if you aren't taking the course, I hope you will find the content helpful! Check out [my YouTube promotional video](https://youtu.be/_AaUKSjTNY8) or the free previews on Udemy to learn more. You can also find the material on [itch.io](https://r3dhummingbird.itch.io/renpy-minigames101).

## What We Will Learn

We will build from scratch a Rhythm Game. This is adapted from [my open-source Rhythm Game Engine on GitHub](https://github.com/RuolinZheng08/renpy-rhythm).

Some experience with Ren'Py, Python, and programming is strongly recommended. This course assumes Python knowledge including data structures (list, dictionaries), functions, and classes (Object-Oriented Programming).

## Course Intro

Are you interested in game development and want to create engaging 2D minigames? Are you a Ren'Py developer looking to implement minigames in your projects? This is the course for you.

This course, **Ren'Py Minigames 101**, covers all the fundamentals you need to build your own minigame in Ren'Py.

The example project that we will work through is a Rhythm Game.

In each lecture, we will make incremental changes to our code, and, at the end of every lecture, we will have a runnable Ren'Py project that shows tangible progress towards the final completed project.

Some topics that we will cover:

- Ren'Py Screens
- Ren'Py Creator-Defined Displayables
- Rendering the game view
- Implementing player controls with PyGame
- Timing the music notes to any song with Python packages like Aubio and Librosa
- Enhancing player experience with a Heads-Up Display (HUD) and other visual cues
- Designing bonus features for the Rhythm Game

By the end of this course, you will:

- Have implemented a rhythm game from scratch
- Be able to build bonus features for the rhythm game if you wish
- Have the skills to build your own minigame in Ren'Py and Python

Join me in this course to level up your programming and game development skills and develop a minigame for your next Ren'Py project!
